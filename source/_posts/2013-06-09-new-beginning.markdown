I think having a blog is helpful is several ways:

*   Forces you to wrap your head around the topics you want to write
    about.
*   Helps you to measure your progress and what you still need to improve.
*   English is not my native language so any opportunity to improve my
    writing skills is excellent.

Writing a blog is a hard job, but I have arrived to a stage in my
life that I need a place where I can store that one-liner that makes
wonders, reflections of the articles and books I am reading and
tutorials of things that took a tooth and nail to get working.

My posts will focus on Ruby, Rails, Objective-C, iOS, Rubymotion and
Computer Science in general.
